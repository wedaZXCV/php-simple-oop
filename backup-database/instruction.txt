The .ibd file here is an inoDB database engine file. The file contains data the user stored into database. So this is actually a backup file. Follow these instructions in order to apply the data into new database. Everything here is done within MySQL Command Line 8.0 - Unicode. Ignore "->" sign.

1. Create new database

-> CREATE DATABASE matplotlib;

2. Create new table inside the previouly created database.
	In order to create the appropriate table, see structure.txt
	The structure is reffered to functi.ibd.
	It is the data structure whose the table functi was created.

-> CREATE TABLE functi (entryName dataType anotherConfig, entryName dataType anotherConfig, entryName dataType anotherConfig);

3. Remove the new, empty table's tablespace   (so remove it's linking from current database movement recording). This function bellow will delete the new table.ibd

-> ALTER TABLE functi DISCARD TABLESPACE;

4. Copy and paste the backup functi.ibd into MySQL database location. It's on:
C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data\database_name\<here>

5. Re-enable the new table's tablespace (in other word link the correct just now pasted data from backup)

-> ALTER TABLE functi IMPORT TABLESPACE;



<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< DONE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Now the process to restore or mobilize database from the backup is completed.
